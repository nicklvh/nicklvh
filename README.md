# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github Profile!

- I am an experienced professional backend developer (learning frontend) and I specialise in API work with JS/TS.

### What do I use?
  - **Languages:** [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (learning)
  - **Tools:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com), [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

### What am I currently working on?
  - [**Joewy:**](https://github.com/nicklvh/joewy) My own personal discord bot, made with the [Sapphire](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/) framework. It will feature a dashboard integrated with the bot, and a lot of features. Joewy will be able to replace most bots, since it is so feature-packed. It will include a moderation system, customizable to your discord server's needs.
